text: "Working with Jeanine as our web developer in building and implementing a new website for the college has been a great experience! I am extremely impressed by her professionalism, her response time, and her ability to think of everything. She is very sharp, thorough, and offers great suggestions. Itâ€™s especially helpful that she has a clear understanding of OU Campus and best practices. I would highly recommend her for any front-end development project!"
