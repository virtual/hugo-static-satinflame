text: "Otero Junior College recently completed a website redesign project with Jeanine. We were very impressed with her knowledge of the CMS platform our website was built upon and the ease at which she could implement the changes that were being proposed. She is a very talented young woman and we are extremely happy with our finished product. We came in on budget and actually a little under the projected timeline, so not only was I happy, so was all the administrators up the line. Thank you Jeanine!"
