Sometimes redesigns need to happen _fast_! If your web team is small or needs a helping hand in preparing your website ready for its big unveil, consider contacting me for information on how I can help!

For this project, I worked with Missy at [Horry Georgetown Technical College](http://www.hgtc.edu) to help her quickly release the [migration](http://support.omniupdate.com/OU Campus10/site-development/migration/index.pdf) of her new beautiful redesign out into the “wild!”

I contributed in the following ways:

*   **Reviewed web templates and suggested critical updates–**Added missing or incomplete meta tags; implemented improvements for SEO including restructuring header tags; added the school name to page titles; created hover animations and/or colors for better usability; and more.
*   **Modified styles for responsive design**–Updated the design of the homepage carousel to look consistent on all devices; modified content styles as necessary; and created new classes as needed to assist with the design.
*   **Investigated and fixed malfunctioning snippets and widgets**–Fixed JavaScript conflicts in forms; corrected misaligned grids and videos; and modified the XSL code as necessary.
*   **Updated .tmpl (template) files to be more useful to end-user**–Changed default settings to remove unused content; added pieces that users would often be adding back in; suggested improvements for templates; and updated existing pages using Find/Replace for template options.
*   **Cross-checked and re-purposed content from previous website**–Thoroughly checked, updated and/or documented any discrepancies between the migrated and previous content; added in new content and links as necessary; and sent daily review e-mails for status of web migration.
*   **Ran reports**–Corrected broken links and fixed file permissions as necessary.

Thanks to Missy for sharing the following client testimonial–what an honor it was to work with her!
