In 2015, I worked with [Vayakone Sphabmixay from SAX, Inc.](http://www.saxproductions.com/vayakone-sphabmixay/) implementing their redesign for Elizabeth City State University in North Carolina. There were many creative design pieces that presented fun challenges for implementing in a responsive environment.

## Historical Year Timeline

The timeline is both collapsible and adapts to mobile devices. In addition, with this and other dynamic pages developed—such as the [Past Presidents of ECSU](http://www.ecsu.edu/about/history/past_presidents.html)—a page scroll to the updated area was necessary to orient users to new information.

## Custom Weather Feed

If you use [OmniUpdate for your Content Management System](http://omniupdate.com/customers/testimonials.html), you can set your feeds to republish every hour. This is perfect for third-party tools that are only free up to a number of page views. For ECSU, the weather feed was implemented using [Weather Underground’s API](http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/) and is re-published on an hourly basis.

## Hover Tiles

The content tiles on [ECSU’s admissions page](http://www.ecsu.edu/admissions/) were designed to link to other elements when a user hovers or clicks on a image.
