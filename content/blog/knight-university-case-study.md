excerpt: "By focusing on users' POV and HMW statements, the Knight University website was redesigned to highlight the content prospective students are looking for in a higher-ed website."

It was time for a redesign of Knight University, and while working through <a href="https://trydesignlab.com/web-design-course/?discount=55551ca2">Designlab's curriculum</a>, I focused on creating a fresh web design with a focus on user needs. *Knight University is for my experimental code/designs and is not a real university.*
