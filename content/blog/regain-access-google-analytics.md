If your site has a mysterious secondary Google Analytics number added to your website's source code or you can't find anyone at your school who seems to know the information for your Google Analytics setup, you may think that the existing information is now lost forever. However, there is one last measure you can try before giving up hope and creating a new Google Analytics account completely. Be sure you can [login to Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) with the email you choose before requesting your email be added to the account in the following steps.

## Prove You Have Access to the Site

Note: Before submitting the form below, be sure you have the proper access to create a file in the main directory of OU Campus. If not, try forwarding this file to your OU Campus manager.

[Prove site ownership](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7268497#prove)

Create a text file from Notepad and update it with the text shown on the website above. Be sure to save the file as `analytics.txt` prior to uploading it to OU Campus, as many installs won't let you change a file extension. Publish and confirm that the file is available at www.myschool.edu/analytics.txt for Google's team to view.

## Request Access from Google

Visit the [Troubleshooter Contact Form](https://support.google.com/analytics/contact/adminleft_ga). Examples of field inputs are as follows:

- Google Ads customer ID: `n/a`
- Last known login email address for Analytics account: `jsmith@myschool.edu`
- Name of last known user: `Jane Smith`
- Website or apps you are tracking: `www.myschool.edu `
- Email address you want to use to log in to Analytics: `myemail@gmail.com`
